# Embedding AI Studio

## Overview

AI Studio is being made importable as a Go library so another control plane
can run it in-process: the host constructs Studio, mounts its HTTP handler
under a path prefix, supplies identity and CSRF, and owns process-wide
concerns (configuration, logging, tracing, lifecycle). The standalone binary
becomes a thin wrapper over the same library.

The work lands in phases, each shippable on its own with standalone
behaviour unchanged:

| Phase | Scope | Status |
|-------|-------|--------|
| 1 | Configuration from a struct; injectable keys and paths; errors instead of process exits | Done |
| 2 | `pkg/studio` (`New`, `HTTPHandler`, `StartGRPC`, `StartProxy`, `Stop`); `ui` embed package; thin `main.go` | Done |
| 3 | Configurable base path for the backend | Done |
| 4 | Pluggable authentication and CSRF | Done |
| 5 | UI served under a base path; host-authentication UI mode | Done |
| 6 | Shipping the built UI to importers | Done |

Decisions that shape the design:

- **Own database.** Studio keeps its own database or schema (`DATABASE_SCHEMA`,
  see "Sharing the host's Postgres"); the host opens it
  with `studio.OpenDatabase(conf)` and passes the result as `Options.DB`, so
  the host never names Studio's gorm. Studio builds with its own copy of
  gorm (`third_party/gorm.io`), which a host's `replace gorm.io/gorm` cannot
  reach; see "gorm isolation" below. Studio's table names are not prefixed.
- **Host-authoritative identity.** The host authenticates the user and Studio
  provisions a matching user on first sight, keeping its own RBAC and groups.
- **One instance per process.** Package-level state that clashes with a host
  is removed; internal singletons stay, and a second instance is refused.

## Configuration (Phase 1)

`config.AppConf` holds everything Studio reads from the environment.

| Function | Behaviour |
|----------|-----------|
| `config.Load(envFile)` | Builds an `AppConf` from the environment, with `envFile` (default `.env`) filling unset variables. Neither caches nor writes to the environment. |
| `config.LoadFrom(getenv)` | Builds an `AppConf` from any lookup function, applying the same defaults. A host uses it to build configuration from its own settings. |
| `config.Set(conf)` | Installs `conf` as the configuration `config.Get` returns. |
| `config.ExportEnvFile(envFile)` | Copies `.env` values into the environment. Only the standalone binary calls it, so packages that still read the environment directly see file values. |
| `config.Get(envFile)` | Returns the installed configuration, loading it from the environment (after `ExportEnvFile`) on first use. |

Settings that were read from the environment at the point of use and now live
on `AppConf`: `SecretKey` (`TYK_AI_SECRET_KEY`), `MicrogatewayEncryptionKey`,
`CSRFTrustedOrigins`, `ExportStoragePath`, `BrandingStoragePath`,
`DebugHTTP`, `ChatUIV2Enabled` and `ChatSessionIdleTTL`. The chat queue's
Postgres listener falls back to `AppConf.DatabaseURL` when the database it was
given carries no DSN (a host that opened it from a `*sql.DB`).

Process-wide values are installed with setters that fall back to the
environment when unset:

- `secrets.SetEncryptionKey(key)` for the key that encrypts secrets at rest.
- `services.SetBrandingStoragePath(path)` for branding assets.
- `grpc.Config.EncryptionKey` for the key edges decrypt credentials with.

Deliberately still environment-only: the network and plugin security knobs
(`ALLOW_INTERNAL_NETWORK_ACCESS`, `PLUGIN_COMMAND_ALLOWLIST`,
`PLUGIN_BLOCK_INTERNAL_URLS`, the plugin allowed directories, `pkg/netguard`),
OCI registry credentials (`OCI_PLUGINS_REGISTRY_*`, which reference other
variables by name), `$ENV/` secret references, and tuning and debug switches
shared with the microgateway (`ANALYTICS_BUFFER_SIZE`, `BUDGET_SYNC_INTERVAL`,
`DEBUG_HTTP_PROXY`, the metrics legacy-names switch).

## Errors instead of exits (Phase 1)

- `api.New` returns an error where the API constructor used to exit (SSO
  initialisation, CSRF key generation, frontend file systems). `api.NewAPI`
  remains as a panicking wrapper for tests. `api.New` leaves `gin.SetMode` to
  the caller.
- `grpc.NewControlServer` returns an error for a missing, short or default
  microgateway encryption key.
- `edition.CheckRegistered` (package `services/edition`) returns an error
  naming any enterprise feature an enterprise build did not register. Call it
  at startup; the per-feature factories would otherwise panic on first use.
- Enterprise licensing: `Start` returns an error when the licence fails
  validation at boot. A failed periodic re-check calls
  `licensing.Config.OnInvalid`; with no callback set the process exits, which
  is what the standalone binaries rely on.
- Email templates are embedded (package `templates`). A `templates/` directory
  in the working directory still takes precedence, so deployments can
  customise them, but a process started elsewhere renders the defaults
  instead of failing.

## The studio package (Phase 2)

`pkg/studio` holds the wiring that used to live in `main.go`; `main.go` is
now a thin wrapper (flags, `config.Get`, logger, connectivity checks, opening
the database with `studio.OpenDatabase`, the docs server, signal handling). See `pkg/studio/README.md`
for the host-facing API.

- `studio.New(Options)` installs the configuration, checks the edition,
  migrates and seeds the database, starts licensing, the service layer,
  marketplace sync, scheduler, analytics, telemetry and plugins, and builds
  the API, gateway and (in control mode) the gRPC control server. Every
  failure is a returned error, and a failed `New` stops whatever it started.
- `HTTPHandler`, `ListenAndServe`, `ProxyHandler`, `StartProxy` and
  `StartGRPC(listener)` serve it. `Stop(ctx)` shuts down the API, gateway,
  gRPC server, plugins and workers, analytics, tracing and licensing in that
  order, and leaves the database open. Previously `Service.Cleanup` closed
  the database before the deferred stops in `main` ran; `Service.Stop` now
  does everything but close it, and `Cleanup` is `Stop` plus the close.
- One Studio runs per process (`ErrAlreadyRunning`); after `Stop`, `New` may
  build another.
- Host-owned telemetry: `Options.Logger` (`logger.Use`),
  `Options.TracerProvider`/`Propagator` (`tracing.Use`) and
  `Options.MeterProvider` (`metrics.InitWithProvider`) keep Studio off
  zerolog's and OpenTelemetry's globals.
- Package `ui` embeds the built frontend (`ui.FS`, rooted at the build
  directory); `api.New` takes it as an `fs.FS`, and `Options.UIAssets`
  overrides it.
- `enterprise/all` (`github.com/TykTechnologies/ai-studio-enterprise/v2/all`)
  imports every enterprise feature; `main_enterprise.go` and enterprise hosts
  import it. The enterprise module is named after its own private repository,
  so a host with read access fetches it like any module; under the old path
  (`midsommar/v2/enterprise`, a directory of this repository that is really a
  submodule) Go could never resolve it.
- Enterprise features register themselves with core through hooks (feature
  factories, `scripting/engine.Register`, the guardrails registry), and
  `services/edition.CheckRegistered` fails `New` when one is missing. No
  public package imports the enterprise module, not even behind the
  `enterprise` build tag, because `go mod tidy` in a host considers every tag
  and would try to fetch the private module; `make enterprise-import-guard`
  (CI) enforces it. Tests may not import it either, because tidy also reads
  the tests of every package it imports: enterprise tests of core packages
  live in the enterprise repository (`enterprise/_coretests`) and
  `make ent-link` links them in. Only the `main_enterprise.go` files, the
  microgateway module and `tests/`, none of which a host imports, may import
  it.
- `grpc.ControlServer.Serve(listener)` serves on a host-supplied listener;
  `API.Shutdown` stops the audit writer even when the host served the router.

## Base path (Phase 3)

`BASE_PATH` (`AppConf.BasePath`, normalised to `/prefix` or `""`) serves the
API and UI under a path prefix. `SITE_URL` (and `AUTH_SERVER_URL`, which
defaults to it) should include the prefix: emails, the OAuth consent
redirect and the OAuth metadata are built from it, and a warning is logged
when it does not end with the base path.

- Routes stay registered at the root. `API.Handler()` (what
  `studio.HTTPHandler` and the standalone server serve) strips the prefix;
  a request without it passes through unchanged, so a reverse proxy may
  strip it first. The bare prefix redirects to `prefix/`.
- The session cookie (`auth.Config.CookiePath`) and the CSRF cookie are
  scoped to the base path.
- Logout expires Studio's session cookie and the identity broker's
  `_gothic_session`, and nothing else (it used to expire every cookie on the
  request, which would sign a user out of the host too).
- Post-SSO redirects and the email-verified page's redirect go to the base
  path instead of `/`.
- OAuth: the consent redirect and the authorization server metadata keep the
  path of `SITE_URL`/`AUTH_SERVER_URL` (`url.JoinPath` instead of resolving
  absolute paths, which dropped it). RFC 8414 discovery for a pathed issuer
  happens at the host root (`/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server/<base>`);
  `studio.OAuthMetadataHandler()` serves it there. The gateway's protected
  resource metadata is unchanged: the gateway keeps its own port.
- The SPA fallback injects a `<base>` element and the frontend bootstrap
  into `index.html` (see Phase 5). `/auth/config` returns `basePath`.
- The resend-verification email linked to `/verify-email`, which nothing
  serves; it now links to `/auth/verify-email` like the registration email.


## Host authentication and CSRF (Phase 4)

`studio.Options.Auth` (an `auth.Authenticator`) lets the host authenticate
every request: `Authenticate(r)` returns the signed-in user as a
`studio.Identity` (`services.HostIdentity`: subject, email, name, admin,
groups), nil when the request has no host identity, or an error to reject
it.

- It runs first in `auth.GetAuthenticatedUser`, so `AuthMiddleware`, RBAC,
  the audit trail (`auth_method = host`) and every handler reading `"user"`
  work unchanged. With no host identity, Studio's API keys still
  authenticate the request; a host error or an identity that cannot be
  provisioned ends it as unauthenticated.
- `Service.ProvisionHostUser` finds the user by `users.external_subject`
  (unique among live users: a partial index that soft-deleted rows do not
  hold). On first sight it links an existing account with the same email
  and no subject, or creates one (`auth_source = host`, verified, portal and
  chat on, a random unusable password). Name, email, administrator status
  and, when `Groups` is not nil, group memberships (by name, always keeping
  Default, unknown names skipped) follow the host through `UpdateUser`, so
  plugin hooks, Enterprise role bindings (admin is an Administrator binding)
  and group rules apply. Unchanged identities write nothing but a login
  stamp at most every 15 minutes. Disabled users are refused, and an email
  linked to another subject is a conflict.
- Host users are externally managed like SSO users
  (`User.IsExternallyManaged`): no API key unless
  `ALLOW_SSO_USER_API_KEYS`, and an issued key lapses once the user stops
  signing in through the host (`SSO_API_KEY_LIVENESS`).
- With `Auth` set, Studio's own sign-in is off: password login,
  registration, password reset, email verification and every SSO route
  answer 404, and the identity broker (whose library keeps process-wide
  state a host running its own broker would clash with) is not started.
  `/auth/config` reports `authMode: "host"` with `loginURL`/`logoutURL`
  from `Options.LoginURL`/`LogoutURL`.
- `Options.CSRF` (`func(http.Handler) http.Handler`, calling the wrapped
  handler only for requests that pass) replaces Studio's gorilla/csrf
  protection; requests with an `Authorization` header and `/oauth/` stay
  exempt as before. `/auth/config` reports `csrfTokenHeader` and
  `csrfTokenURL` (defaults `X-CSRF-Token` and `<base>/csrf-token`, or
  `Options.CSRFTokenHeader`/`CSRFTokenURL`).
- Studio's own CSRF key can now be stable across restarts and replicas:
  `CSRF_KEY` (the token key is derived from it). `CSRF_COOKIE_NAME`
  renames the cookie when a host on the same domain also uses gorilla's
  default.
- The console labels host-provisioned users ("Host application") and can
  filter by that origin. Using `authMode` (redirecting to the host's login,
  hiding login and SSO pages) is Phase 5.

`pkg/studio` tests run on Postgres, one schema per test, when
`STUDIO_TEST_POSTGRES_DSN` is set.

## Frontend under a base path, and host sign-in (Phase 5)

One frontend build serves any base path:

- It is built with a relative public path (`"homepage": "."`, and
  `PUBLIC_URL="."` in the Dockerfile and the release, prod and benchmark
  builds), so `index.html` loads `./static/...` and the CSS refers to
  `../../static/media/...`.
- The server injects `<base href="<base>/">` (`<base href="/">` at the
  root) so those relative URLs resolve from any client-side route, and
  `window.__TYK_AI_STUDIO__`: `basePath`, `authMode`, `loginURL`,
  `logoutURL`, `csrfTokenHeader`, `csrfTokenURL` (`api.frontendBootstrap`,
  the same values `/auth/config` reports). It is read synchronously, so it
  applies before the first request.
- `src/runtimeConfig.js` reads it. `withBase(path)` puts an absolute path
  under the base; `stripBase(pathname)` turns a browser path into a route.
  The router gets `basename`; `apiClient` (`/api/v1`) and `pubClient` (via
  `getBaseUrl`) carry the base, so the hundreds of client calls and router
  links need no change. Everything the browser loads directly goes through
  `withBase`: logos, branding, `window.location`/`window.open`,
  `fetch`/`EventSource`, the OAuth consent page, plugin iframes and remote
  entries. Comparisons against `window.location.pathname` use `stripBase`.
- `src/basePathGuard.test.js` fails on new root-absolute URLs in those
  places.
- CSRF tokens are fetched from `csrfTokenURL` and sent in `csrfTokenHeader`.
- Host sign-in: with `authMode: "host"` a signed-out visitor goes to
  `loginURL` (the login route shows a pointer to it), and logout goes to
  `logoutURL` after Studio's own sign-out.
- Fixed on the way: the admin plugin iframe loaded `/plugins/assets/...`,
  which no route serves (now `/api/v1/plugins/assets/...`), and "mark plugin
  UI loaded" posted to a doubled `/api/v1/api/v1/...`.
- `config/docs_links.json` is embedded (an on-disk copy still overrides it),
  so documentation links work from any working directory.

`examples/embed-host` is a runnable host: its own login page and cookie, an
`Authenticator` over that cookie, Studio at `/ai-studio`, and the OAuth
discovery document at the host root.

Verified by hand in a browser: the standalone binary with
`BASE_PATH=/ai-studio` (registration, login, admin, portal and chat,
deep-link reloads, logout; every request stayed under the prefix), the same
build at the root, and `embed-host` (host login, provisioning as an
administrator, logout through the host).

## UI assets for importers (Phase 6)

`go:embed` needs the built frontend at compile time, and
`ui/admin-frontend/build` is not committed, so a host that imports Studio
as a module cannot compile the default `ui` package.

- `ui` embeds `admin-frontend/build` by default (`ui/embed.go`). With the
  `studio_noui` build tag (`ui/noui.go`) it embeds only `ui/noui/index.html`,
  a tracked placeholder page, and `ui.Embedded` is false. `pkg/studio` then
  expects `Options.UIAssets` and logs a warning without it. `pkg/studio`
  imports nothing else that embeds uncommitted files (the docs site server
  is only in `main`).
- The `ui-assets` job in `release.yml` builds the frontend once per tag,
  packs it as `tyk-ai-studio-ui-<tag>.tar.gz` with a `.sha256`, and uploads
  both to the tag's GitHub release, creating a draft release when there is
  none. It is the only job with `contents: write`.
- A host builds with `-tags studio_noui`, unpacks the tarball for the Studio
  version it imports, and passes `os.DirFS(dir)` (or its own embed of the
  directory) as `Options.UIAssets`. `examples/embed-host -ui <dir>` does
  this.

Verified: with `ui/admin-frontend/build` moved away, the default build of
`pkg/studio` fails on the embed pattern and the `studio_noui` build of
`pkg/studio` and `examples/embed-host` succeeds; that `studio_noui` host,
given a tarball made as the release job makes it, serves the full console
under `/ai-studio`.


## Pages without Studio's chrome

A host that draws its own navigation (the Tyk Dashboard's top bar and
sidebar) sets `Options.Chromeless`:

- The bootstrap (`window.__TYK_AI_STUDIO__`) and `/auth/config` carry
  `chrome: "none"` (`"full"` otherwise).
- `layouts/MainLayout.js` then leaves out `TopNavigation` (the Admin /
  Portal / Chat switch and the user menu) and the admin, portal and chat
  drawers; pages take the full width.
- Sticky page headers sit below `--studio-header-height`, a CSS variable
  that defaults to the 64px top bar (`index.css`) and that
  `runtimeConfig.applyChrome` sets to 0 when chromeless. Pages used to
  hard-code `top="64px"`.
- The host links straight to Studio's routes under the base path
  (`/admin/llms`, `/portal/dashboard`, `/chat/...`), and builds its menu
  from `GET /common/nav` (below).

### Navigation manifest

`GET /common/nav` (`api/nav.go`) returns what the signed-in user may
navigate to:

- `surfaces`: Admin (`/admin`, when the user holds any permission), AI
  Portal (`/portal/dashboard`) and Chat (`/chat/dashboard`), gated as the
  console's top bar gates them (the user's show-portal / show-chat options
  and the licensed features).
- `admin`: the admin menu, as groups (`items`) of pages, each with `id`,
  `text`, `path` (a console route without the base path), `icon` (a Font
  Awesome name), `exact`, and the `permission` that unlocks it. Plugin
  sections carry `pluginId`. Entries the user may not open are already
  left out, with the drawer's rule: a group stays while one of its pages
  does.

The manifest is the one source of truth: the console's admin drawer
(`Drawer.js`) renders from it, reloading when the user's permissions change
or a plugin UI is installed. Group order, feature gates (portal, chat,
gateway-only, Enterprise-only groups) and plugin placement are tested in
`api/nav_test.go`. `TestAdminNavGolden` writes the full menu to
`ui/admin-frontend/src/admin/nav.golden.json` (`UPDATE_NAV_GOLDEN=1` to
regenerate), and `nav.golden.test.js` checks every page in it against
`admin/routes.js`, including that the menu and the route need the same
permission. The portal and chat drawers still build their menus in the
console.
- `examples/embed-host -chromeless` shows it.

## Module layout

A host imports the root module only. The root module does not require the
microgateway module: the gateway plugin interfaces and SDK that `pkg/plugin_sdk`
uses live in `pkg/gatewayplugin/{interfaces,sdk}`, and the gateway management
gRPC API is generated from `proto/microgateway_management.proto` into
`proto/microgateway_management`. The old paths under `microgateway/plugins/`
and `microgateway/proto/microgateway_management` are deprecated forwarding
packages (type aliases and wrappers, generated when the code moved) so that
existing plugins keep compiling. The proto package name is unchanged, so the
wire format and gRPC method names are the same.

## Releases a host can import

Every `v*` tag is a version of `github.com/TykTechnologies/midsommar/v2` a
host can `go get` (the module proxy builds its zip from the tagged tree;
`make module-check` keeps that tree valid). `release.yml` then:

- builds the enterprise edition from the commit the `enterprise` submodule
  pins, not from the enterprise repository's current main;
- tags `github.com/TykTechnologies/ai-studio-enterprise` with the same
  version on that commit (`scripts/release/tag-enterprise.sh`), refusing a
  pin that is not on enterprise main, so an enterprise host requires both
  modules at one version;
- runs `scripts/release/consume-module.sh` for both editions: a throwaway
  host with a clean module cache imports the tag through the proxy, runs
  `go mod tidy` and builds with `CGO_ENABLED=0`. The Community Edition run
  has no credentials at all.

The same script checks any commit by hand, e.g.
`scripts/release/consume-module.sh ce <commit>`.

## Host version floor

When a host imports Studio, Go's version selection picks, for every module,
the highest version any `go.mod` in the build requires. So each Studio
requirement above the host's own upgrades the host silently, and a host
dependency newer than Studio's is what Studio actually runs with there.
Studio's `go.mod` (and the enterprise module's) therefore follows the Tyk
Dashboard's:

- Where both require a module, Studio uses the Dashboard's version, up or
  down (2026-09-30: TIB 1.8, libopenapi 0.36, gorilla/sessions 1.4,
  go-redis 9.18, nats 1.49, the AWS and Google SDKs and more up; pgx,
  gosimple/slug and mergo down). The `go` directive matches the Dashboard's
  (`go 1.26.5`, `toolchain go1.26.6` for Studio's own builds).
- Where a Studio dependency needs a newer version, the module is in
  `scripts/host-compat-allow.txt` with the dependency that needs it (the
  OpenTelemetry 1.46 exporters, the Prometheus client behind the otel
  Prometheus exporter, go-openapi v0.25+, weaviate). Each was checked by
  lowering it alone: every one drags others down with it.
- `mattn/go-sqlite3` is deliberately not aligned: the Dashboard carries the
  retracted `v2.0.3+incompatible`, and `pkg/studio` does not link SQLite.

`make host-compat` (`scripts/host-compat.sh --build`, a CI job on this
repository's branches) fetches the Dashboard's `go.mod` at run time (its
repository is private; never commit a copy) and:

1. fails if Studio or the enterprise module requires anything above the
   Dashboard's version that the allowlist does not name
   (`tools/hostcompat`, no network);
2. builds `pkg/studio` for both editions inside the Dashboard's module
   graph, its requirements and replaces included, with `CGO_ENABLED=0`, and
   lists every module that ends up above the Dashboard's `go.mod`. That list
   also shows raises from the `go.mod` files of Studio's dependencies, which
   the first check cannot see; most come from
   `github.com/weaviate/weaviate`, the server module, of which Studio only
   uses `entities/models`.

A host that never builds the enterprise edition can build, tidy and verify
Studio without access to the private enterprise module, but `go list -m
all` fails there: it resolves every module in the graph, including the
enterprise module Studio's `go.mod` names at a placeholder version. The
Dashboard always builds the enterprise edition, requiring a real version.

## Sharing the host's Postgres

A host can give Studio a schema in its own database instead of a database of
its own: `Config.DatabaseSchema` (`DATABASE_SCHEMA`) makes
`studio.OpenDatabase` create the schema when missing and pin `search_path` to
it alone (not `schema,public`: Postgres skips missing entries and gorm's
migrator creates tables in `current_schema()`, so a fallback would put
tables in `public`). Studio's unprefixed table names (`users`, `roles`,
`audit_records`, `tyk_policies`, ...) then cannot collide with the host's.
Raw SQL in Studio never qualifies a schema, and the schema snapshot goldens
are schema-independent, so nothing else changes.

`studio.New` runs every migration and seed, from `models.InitModels` through
the RBAC seed (plus the analytics and identity broker tables, which used to
migrate later), under `models.AcquireMigrationLock`: a Postgres session
advisory lock on a connection of its own, keyed by the current schema, so
replicas sharing one schema take turns and different schemas do not wait
for each other. On SQLite, or with a pool of one connection, it is a no-op.
Tests: `pkg/studio/database_schema_postgres_test.go`. Concurrent unlocked
boots of a fresh schema did not fail in tests (the seeds are protected by
unique constraints), so the lock is a guard for upgrades, where replicas
starting together would run the same ALTERs and backfills, rather than for
an observed race.

## Several replicas

A host may run several Studio replicas against one database. Each joins
the cluster in `studio.New` (`Options.NodeID`, default a fresh per-process
ID): a registry row other replicas use to tell live replicas from dead ones,
and an event log for what every replica must hear. Edge streams record their
owning replica. See `features/ClusterControlPlane.md` for the guarantees
and what is still being built.

## langchaingo in tree

Studio's langchaingo fork (Anthropic temperature, OpenAI reasoning_effort and
other fixes) lives in `third_party/langchaingo` and is imported by its
in-tree path. It used to be a `replace` in `go.mod`, which Go ignores in a
module that imports Studio, so a host would have built with upstream
langchaingo instead. `make langchaingo-verify` keeps upstream imports out.
See `third_party/README.md`.

## gorm isolation

The Tyk Dashboard `replace`s `gorm.io/gorm` with a fork, and a `replace`
applies to the whole build. So Studio imports gorm and its postgres and
sqlite drivers from its own copy,
`github.com/TykTechnologies/midsommar/v2/third_party/gorm.io/...`, and the
Dashboard's replace cannot reach it. `third_party/README.md` has the details.

- The copy is the published modules at the versions pinned in
  `third_party/gorm-pin/go.mod`, with their `gorm.io/...` imports rewritten.
  `scripts/gorm-vendor.sh` (`make gorm-vendor`) is the only thing that
  writes it. No automation changes the pins, so an upgrade is always a
  deliberate PR whose diff is the upstream change.
- `make gorm-verify`, a CI job, checks two things. The tree must be exactly
  what the pins produce. And no package of the root, microgateway or
  enterprise module may import `gorm.io/...`. gorm finds model hooks, column
  types and sentinel errors by type assertion at runtime, so a stray import
  of another gorm compiles and then fails silently. Third-party libraries may use
  upstream gorm internally (TIB 1.8's `TykTechnologies/storage` does); the
  check allows those importers by prefix. Also, `go mod tidy`
  would resolve `gorm.io/gorm` to v1.21.16, the version the Tyk gateway
  module requires.
- The schema snapshot tests (`models/`, `microgateway/internal/database/`)
  pin what the migrations produce on SQLite and Postgres. The hook canary
  (`models/hooks_canary_test.go`) ties every model hook to the copy's
  callback interfaces.
- The drivers underneath (pgx, go-sqlite3) are not copied. They stay
  ordinary requirements, because a second copy would register the same
  `database/sql` driver name again and panic. In a host's build they may
  move up to the host's versions.
- A host uses `studio.OpenDatabase` for `Options.DB` and never imports
  gorm. Its binary carries both gorms, about 2–3 MB.

## Building without cgo

A host may build with `CGO_ENABLED=0` (the Tyk Dashboard's dev builds do), so
`pkg/studio` links nothing that needs cgo. `TestHostBuildHasNoCgoOnlyDependencies`
(`pkg/studio/deps_test.go`) and a CI build step keep it that way.

- **SQLite** (go-sqlite3 needs cgo) lives in `pkg/studio/sqlitedb`, which
  registers itself with `studio.RegisterDatabaseDriver`. The standalone
  binary and `examples/embed-host` import it, so standalone Studio still
  runs on SQLite. A host that does not import it opens Postgres only, and
  asking for `sqlite` gives an error naming the package.
- **Chroma**: chroma-go's v2 client loads a tokenizer and the ONNX runtime
  through cgo. `data_session/chroma.go` is `//go:build cgo`, and
  `chroma_nocgo.go` stands in for it: Chroma datasources return
  `ErrChromaUnavailable`, and Chroma is left out of the vector store lists.
  chroma-go v0.4 was not an option: it adds an embedded runtime, and
  `chroma-go-local@v0.3.4`, which it requires, failed checksum-database
  verification (2026-09-29).
- The microgateway is not embedded and keeps its cgo build and local SQLite.
